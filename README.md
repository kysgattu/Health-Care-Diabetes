- ***Accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes.***



**Abstract:**

Neural networks or connectionist models for parallel processing are not new. However, a resurgence of interest in the past half decade has occurred. In part, this is related to a better understanding of what are now referred to as hidden nodes. These algorithms are considered to be of marked value in pattern recognition problems. Because of that, we tested the ability of an early neural network model, ADAP, to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus in a high risk population of Pima Indians. The algorithm's performance was analyzed using standard measures for clinical tests: sensitivity, specificity, and a receiver operating characteristic curve. The crossover point for sensitivity and specificity is 0.76. We are currently further examining these methods by comparing the ADAP results with those obtained from logistic regression and linear perceptron models using precisely the same training and forecasting sets. A description of the algorithm is included.
